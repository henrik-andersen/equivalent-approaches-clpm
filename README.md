# Description 

This article looks at panel regression models in structural equation modeling that combine static and dynamic components. 

It focuses on a comparison of the Autoregressive Latent Trajectory (ALT), Dynamic Panel Model (DPM), Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals (LCM-SR) and Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM). 

It shows that the RI-CLPM and LCM-SR are equivalent to *constrained* versions of the DPM and ALT, respectively. 

This places potentially unrealistic assumptions on the initial conditions, i.e., the process that was occuring before the observation period began. 

Because of this, in situations in which the process under investigation is not both *stationary* and at *equilibrium*, the RI-CLPM and LCM-SR will return biased estimates of the autoregressive and cross-lagged parameters. This is shown analytically and using the example of cigarette smoking amongst adolescents. 

To use these models on data that violate the initial conditions assumptions, the individual effects must be allowed to covary with the initial residuals. This results in a kind of *predetermined* RI-CLPM or LCM-SR.
